# Problem Statement:
We are analyzing the effect of restraunts and eateries on Airbnb listings in New York City. We have chosen New York City as it is one of the largest and most popular tourist destinations in the world with a large amount of Airbnb listings.

## Questions:
We are looking to answer the following questions using the data:
* Is there a correlation between the number of restraunts in a particular area and the number of Airbnb listings in that area?
* How does the price of Airbnb listings vary according to the presence of restraunts in that region?

## Data Sources:
The data we are using comes from the [Airbnb website](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) and the restraunt data is pulled from the [NYC restraunt database](https://mgrimshaw.carto.com/tables/nytimes_nyc_restaurants/public) published by Miles Grimshaw.
